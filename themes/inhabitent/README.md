# Project 4 - Inhabitent

This is a project at RED Academy Web Developer Program to showcase the creation of a custom Wordpress theme, forked from Underscores. It also involved creating a plugin for a custom widget.

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `themes/inhabitent` directory

Give your theme an apropriate name.

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so changew `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
